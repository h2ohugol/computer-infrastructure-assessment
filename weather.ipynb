    "### Task 1: Create Directory Structure \n",
    " \n",
    "All tasks in this project are carried out in [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) within [Linux Bash environment](https://www.javatpoint.com/linux-bash) as part of the Computer Infrastructure Assessment. This setup provides a solid built and practical platform for managing and executing [commands](https://github.com/trinib/Linux-Bash-Commands) efficiently.  \n",

This foundational step ensures efficient organization of files and data for the project as it progresses.  \n",

    "At this stage, essential Linux commands are utilized, such as `cd`, `.` and `..` for directory navigation, `ls` to list contents, and file viewing with [more](https://linuxhandbook.com/more-command/) and [cat](https://linuxhandbook.com/cat-command/). Building on these fundamentals, commands like [mkdir](https://linuxhandbook.com/mkdir-command/) for creating directories, [rmdir](https://linuxhandbook.com/rmdir-command/) for removing them, and file editing with tools like [nano](https://linuxhandbook.com/nano-editor-basics/) or [vi](https://www.javatpoint.com/vi-editor) are applied.  \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Creating and Appending Files with Timestamps\n",
    "\n",
    "This task focuses on creating and appending files, emphasizing the importance of timestamps for tracking events, especially when working across multiple time zones. The `date` command with the format `+\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\"` is used to generate precise timestamps. This introduces the fundamentals of handling [timestamps](https://www.lenovo.com/ie/en/glossary/timestamp/?orgRef=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.ie%252F&srsltid=AfmBOopf3SlJnpeNNvJiDISLPR7b58DYONILTyZ7IF1M6I3zOFVye3ND#:~:text=Learn%20More-,What%20is%20a%20timestamp%3F,deduplication%20systems%20can%20identify%20identical%20data%20chunks%20and%20store%20them%20only,-once%2C%20reducing%20storage), an essential yet often underappreciated skill.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It's crucial to differentiate between the append operator [>>](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-append-text-to-end-of-file/) and the overwrite operator [>](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/171025/what-does-do-vs).

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Capture System Memory Usage with Timestamped Files\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "free -h > `date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S.txt\"`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `free -h` command provides a summary of system memory usage in a human-readable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\"` command generates a timestamp in the format `YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS`. \n",
    "\n",
    "  For example, `20241110_153045` represents **November 10, 2024, at 3:30:45 PM**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Backticks are used to execute the `date` command and embed its output into the file name dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `>` operator redirects the output of `free -h` into the timestamped file, ensuring a unique file for each execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Use Timestamps?\n",
    "- [Formatting timestamps](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/Formatting-file-timestamps.html) prevent overwriting files, especially in fast-paced processes where multiple files may be created within short timeframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- While milliseconds could be used for higher precision, second-level accuracy is sufficient for this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Notes\n",
    "- To explore more formatting options for the `date` command, use the `man date` manual. Exit the manual by pressing `q`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example file name:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Running the command on **November 10, 2024, at 3:30:45 PM** will create a file named:\n",

    "### Task 4: Create Timestamped Files\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating Files with Unique, Chronologically Organized Names\n",
    "\n",
    "Timestamped files are a practical way to manage files in a structured and orderly manner. By generating filenames based on the current timestamp, you can ensure unique and sortable file names. This method is especially useful in environments where multiple files are created rapidly, as it prevents overwriting and maintains a logical sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an empty file with a timestamped name, use the `touch` command combined with the `date` command. The `date` command dynamically generates the timestamp, which is embedded in the file name using backticks. This approach eliminates the need for redirection (`>>`) and ensures a clean, organized file creation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Command Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Create an empty file with a timestamped name\n",
    "touch `date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S.txt\"`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `touch` command creates an empty file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\"` command formats the current date and time into a string, such as `20241219_151530` \n",
    "for **December 19, 2024, at 3:15:30 PM**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Backticks execute the `date` command and use its output as the file name, ensuring each file has a unique name based on the precise time of creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of Timestamped Files\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Chronological Organization**: Files are automatically sorted by time, making them easier to locate and manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prevents Overwriting**: Each file has a unique name, eliminating the risk of overwriting existing files.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Streamlined File Management**: Automates the naming process, reducing manual intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoid using a single redirection operator (>) in scenarios where preserving existing data is critical, as it will overwrite the file contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For more date formatting options, refer to the `man date` manual (exit with q).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example file name:\n",
    "  - Running the command on **December 19, 2024, at 3:15:30 PM** will create a file named:\n",

    "#### HTTP and Its Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
