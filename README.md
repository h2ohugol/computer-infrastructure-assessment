This repository contains my assessment submission for the computer infrastructure module

Overview

This project focuses on learning essential data handling and automation skills using the
command line. You'll work through tasks that involve creating directory structures, handling timestamps,
formatting them, and using them for file creation. You’ll also download structured weather data from Met Éireann's
API timestamp the data, and automate the process using a bash script.

Tasks Summary

1.Create Directory Structure: Set up folders using the command line.
2.Timestamps: Log and verify timestamps in a file.
3.Formatting Timestamps: Format timestamps to prevent duplicate filenames.
4.Create Timestamped Files: Generate files with timestamped names.
5.Download Weather Data: Retrieve weather data using wget.
6.Timestamp the Data: Save downloaded data with a timestamped filename.
7.Write the Script: Automate the download and save process with a bash script.

Each task builds a foundational understanding for data management and automation in a simple yet powerful way.
